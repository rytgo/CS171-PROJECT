## **Description of Question and Research Topic**

Diabetes is a chronic disease that is caused when one's blood sugar (glucose) levels cannot be properly regulated. Glucose is the body's main source of energy; With lack of proper management or diagnosis, it can lead to serious health complications down the line. Diabetes can be influenced by one's biological and lifestyle factors. Our project aims to develop and train machine learning models to predict or detect person's likelihood of having (or developing) diabetes. 

**Can lifestyle, health, and demographic features be used to predict diabetes risk?**

## **Project Outline**

1. **Data Preparation:** Search publicly available datasets (Kaggle, UCI), clean, and normalize.
    
2. **Model Building:** Each partner implements and develops a separate model.
    
3. **Evaluation:** Compute accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC
    
4. **Analysis:** Compare and visualize model predictions and evaluate its overall performance
## **Data Collection Plan**

### **Ryan Tran**

- **Dataset:** Pima Indians Diabetes Database
    
- **Content:** 768 patient records with variables such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, and outcome (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes).
    
- **Cleaning Steps:** Check missing zeros, normalize features, and split into train/test sets.

## Model Plans:
Random Forest Classifier
Clustering (?) or (KNN OR Logistic Regression)

Our goal is to predict diabetes presence/risk, these models capture important patterns in an interpretable manner.


##  **Project Timeline:**

- Week 9-10 → Data exploration and cleaning
    
- Week 11–12 → Model building
    
- Week 13–14 → Evaluation and analysis
    
- Week 15–16 → Presentation and final changes
